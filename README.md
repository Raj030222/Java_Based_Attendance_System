# Java_Based_Attendance_System
The Student Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking and managing student attendance. The system records and manages daily attendance details for students based on their presence in class.

Features:
Daily Attendance Recording: Attendance is logged daily by faculty members, based on student presence.
Role-Based Access: Faculty members and staff are provided with unique usernames and passwords to manage attendance.
Attendance Reports: Generate monthly and consolidated attendance reports for each student.
Eligibility Evaluation: Helps in evaluating students' eligibility based on their attendance.
Automation: The system automatically generates attendance reports at the end or during the academic session.
Modules:
Admin Module:

Manages the creation of new batches.
Handles faculty assignments and subject updates.
Sends important notices and updates.
User Module:

Used by faculty or operators to mark and manage student attendance.
Faculty can manage attendance for their specific subject.
Purpose:
The main objective of this system is to digitize and automate the traditional method of tracking student attendance. By automating this process, it saves time for staff and ensures accurate and easily accessible attendance records.

Future Scope:
While the current system is developed as a desktop application tailored for individual institutions, it can later be modified to function as an online platform, allowing for broader use and accessibility.
